                    ANS:</strong>
                The Bankey Bihari Temple has the idol of Sri Krishna which is very old and marks the ancient
                civilization in a great way&#8228; The interesting thing about the temple is that there are no conches
                or
                shells being played inside the temple&#8228; The reason was that Bankey Bihari did not like the sound of
                conch
                or shells&#8228;<br><br>
                <strong>History of Mathura</strong><br>
                Sri Krishna is the sole idol which made Mathura a heavenly abode&#8228; It is the birth place of Krishna
                and he is
                considered as the re incarnation of Lord Vishnu&#8228; Vrindavan also has memories of Sri Krishna with
                the Mauryan
                Empire&#44; the spread of Hinduism also increased in the place of Mathura&#8228;<br><br><br>
                <strong> Prem Temple</strong>
                <br>
                The Prem temple is one of the most devoted temples of Vrindavan&#8228; The temple has two floors where 1
                floor
                is dedicated to Ram and Sita and the Pious Hanuman&#8228; The second floor is dedicated to Krishna and
                Radha&#8228;
                The interiors of the temple have precious stones in it and also the temple is made of pure
                sandalwood&#8228;
                The temple is 125 feet high with beautiful walls and carvings&#8228;
                <br>
                Imbued with elegance and grandeur&#44; the Prem Mandir is a massive temple that was shaped by
                <b>Jagadguru Shri
                    Kripaluji Maharaj</b> in the year 2001&#8228; Known as "Temple of God&#8218;s love"&#44; this grand
                religious place is
                dedicated to Radha Krishna as well as Sita Ram&#8228; Located in Vrindavan&#44; the holy city in the
                district of
                Mathura in Uttar Pradesh&#44; the temple is enveloped with piousness and serenity&#8228; This newly
                constructed
                temple is the most beautiful in the entire Brij area and is crowded with devotees during the time of the
                Aarti&#8228;
                <br><br>
                Made out of white marble and adorned with very intricate carvings&#44; this temple is also famous for
                its
                architectural beauty&#8228; Statues of Shri Krishna and his admirers&#44; portraying essential occasions
                surrounding the Lord&#8218;s life&#44; cover the main temple&#8228; Various scenes from Krishna&#8218;s
                life&#44; like raising the
                Govardhan Mountain&#44; have been depicted on the periphery of the Prem Mandir&#8228; The lighting of
                the temple
                further glorifies its spectacular look&#44; especially during the night&#8228; The colored water twists
                and twirls
                to the tunes of the kirtans of Radha Krishna being played nearby and are an audio-visual
                delight&#8228;<br>
                The foundation stone of the Prem Mandir was laid by Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj on 14 January 2001
                in the presence of thousands of devotees&#8228; The Prem Mandir was dedicated to Shri Vrindavan Dham and was
                built under the sponsorship of Jagadguru Kripalu Prishat (JKP)&#44; which is an international&#44; non&hyphen;profit&#44;
                spiritual&#44; educational&#44; social and charitable organisation&#8228; The organisation was founded by Jagadguru
                Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj himself&#8228; It took about 11 to 12 years to complete the temple&#44; and after the
                inauguration ceremony from 15 February to 17 February 2012&#44; the temple was finally opened to the public
                on 17 February in the same year&#8228;
